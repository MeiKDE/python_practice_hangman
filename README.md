# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game written in Python.    

The game is played by guessing a letter or a word. If the letter or word is in the word to be guessed, the game will reveal the letters in the word. If the letter or word is not in the word to be guessed, the game will reveal a part of the Hangman figure. The game will continue until the word is guessed or the player runs out of guesses.
